A Winter Love
by Lang Leav

We were like
    the raging sea,
    a winter Love
    that could not be.

Our voices were 
    the ocean's roar
    we cried until
    we could cry no more.
    
We mocked the storms
    and they fell the trees,
    our broken limbs
    among scattered leaves.

The tides had shown
    what we did not heed,
    the water holds---
    and then recedes.
